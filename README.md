## Hello

- My personal website is located [here](https://www.wavelet.space/vault/). It is quite a mess at this moment but I!am working on that.
- I'm member of [Wavelet](https://github.com/wavelet-space) organization. it is a one-man show at this moment but it may change in the near future. 
- **I'm open for collaboration as a contractor, mostly for Python based projects**
