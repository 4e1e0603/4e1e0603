## Hello

- My personal website is located [here](https://www.wavelet.space/vault/). It is really a mess at this moment, but I am working on that. You know, [everything si a draft](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13).
- I'm a member of the [Czech Radio](https://github.com/czech-radio) and [Wavelet](https://github.com/wavelet-space) organization. The former is my current employer (thanks for that) and the latter is a one-man show at this moment, but that may change in the future. All new personal projects are developed there. Stay tuned. 
- **I'm open to collaboration**, mostly for Python-based projects.

And finally a few words of wisdom.
