## Hello

- My personal website is located [here](https://www.wavelet.space/vault/). It is quite a mess at this moment, but I am working on that.
- I'm a member of the [Wavelet](https://github.com/wavelet-space) organization. It is a one-man show at this moment, but that may change in the near future.
- **I'm open to collaboration**, mostly for Python-based projects.
