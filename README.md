Hello, I am a _chaotic good_ programmer with an interest in __business analysis__, __simulations__, __visualization__ of all kinds, __domain modeling__, __workflow systems__, and __computer language design__ and __history__. Here is a list of programming languages and other technologies which I more or less use: __C++^__, __Julia'__, __Python^__, __Fortran'__,  __R__, __Rust'__, __Scala'__, __Wolfram^__, __SQL__^, __REST__, __Docker__, __Excel__, __Ubuntu / Debian__ / __Windows__ OS. Feel free to contact me if you want to help with something or only to get talk or beer or both.

&mdash;All the best, 𝕯𝔞𝔳𝔦𝔡 𝕷𝔞𝔫𝔡𝔞
